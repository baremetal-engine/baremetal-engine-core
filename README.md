# BareMetal Engine Core

This is a fork of the Godot Engine, modified with a singular mission:

> **Run photorealistic graphics on the lowest possible GPU — and prove the power of true optimization.**

We are stripping away bloat, tightening performance, and rebuilding the pipeline with *brutal efficiency* in mind.
